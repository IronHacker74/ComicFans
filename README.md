###The API
This app uses Marvel's API that holds all of the information around Marvel comics and the stories, characters, creators, and more that connect together. Due to the amount of information that is held in this API, it had to be reduced down in order to break down the challenge...
###The Challenge
The one challenge that I wanted to solve when building this application was the infinite loop of discovering the Marvel comics. Nearly every story, character, creator, comic has another attached to it. Meaning that if you tap on The Avengers, for example, then you should be able to tap into characters like Black Widow and The Hulk or stories like X-Men vs Avengers. To do this I made the architecture generic so that any single item detail can tap into another. You could get lost inside a hole of information that you didn't know how it started.
